Data-driven modeling in ecology: A case-study in research, education, and professional development

The monarch butterfly, the "king of the butterflies", was recently added to the endangered species list
in 2016.  Their numbers have dropped over 80% in the past decade, in large part to the synchronous drop
in Asclepias syriaca, or common milkweed, which is the monarch's sole food source while in their larval state.
In this talk, I will introduce an integral projection model that is used to explore the possible effects and
sensitivity of herbivory on population growth of milkweed.  Integral projection models are fantastic examples of
models that have strong connections with real-world data, utilizing ideas from calculus, linear algebra
and statistics.  I will also discuss the importance of reproducibility in research, specifically as it pertains to
data cleaning and modeling scripts, and how software development and dissemination is an underappreciated and highly
important aspect of the scientific enterprise.


"Are Monarch Butterflies the Panda Bears of Climate Change?" (article, Kingsolver)

Reproducibility
Scripting; R-Markdown
Open Education Practices
Open-Source Software development; static, published paper vs. dynamic, changing software
Materials and Methods for computational models; Include "verbal" description (ODD)
What level of detail with scripts?  Must be useable!!!  Making code available is not enough.
